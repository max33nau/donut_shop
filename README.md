# donut_shop

Programmer: Max Jacobsen

My goal during this project was trying to not repeat myself when writing code.
I wanted to be able to have each object be evaluated without have to write the
same thing over and over. I was able to accomplish this by using for loops
and creating empty arrays that grew as my loops ran. It worked out a lot better
than I thought and I think my code is pretty small for everything that it is doing.

The main thing that I looked at was the color schemes on color.adobe.com . That really
help me see good colors that contrasted each other. I also looked at a couple donut
websites to kind of see how they did their layout. I went with what looked best to me.
I think CSS is very important when it comes to designing your web page. If it doesn't
look pleasurable, Users aren't going to watch to navigate it.
