My goal during this project was trying to not repeat myself when writing code.
I wanted to be able to have each object be evaluated without have to write the
same thing over and over. I was able to accomplish this by using for loops
and creating empty arrays that grew as my loops ran. It worked out a lot better
than I thought and I think my code is pretty small for everything that it is doing.
