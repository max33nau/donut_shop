      <p> Below is a table that shows the franchise locations of Top Pot Donuts in the first
        column. The number of donuts to make are our numbers next to those locations
        and are based on the hours of operation - 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM - and a few factors
         unique to each location: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The mimimum number of customers per hour. </li>
        <li> The maximum number of customers per hour. </li>
        <li> The average number of donuts purchased per customer. </li>
      </ul>
